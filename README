Thanks for using this :)

Couple things you need to know:
when it first boots up, it creates a folder "/plugins/DQSData"
Inside that folder will be a file named "config.txt"
To set a delay on a command, put this in the config

<cmd> <time (milliseconds>

So if you wanted to delay the time between teleports to 5 seconds, you'd do
tp 5000
